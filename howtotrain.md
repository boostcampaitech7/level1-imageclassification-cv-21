# Getting Started
===============

This project requires a conda environment with specific dependencies. Please follow the steps below to set up the environment and execute the train.py file.

## Step 1: Install Conda Environment Dependencies
First, create a conda environment using the requirements.yaml file:

```conda env create -f requirements.yaml```
This will create a new conda environment with all the necessary dependencies.

## Step 2: Activate the Conda Environment
To activate the conda environment, run the following command:

```conda activate myenv```
Replace myenv with the name of the environment specified in the requirements.yaml file.

## Step 3: Run the train.py File
Once the environment is activated, you can execute the train.py file using Python:

```python train.py```
Make sure to run this command from the directory where the train.py file is located.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the installation or execution of the train.py file, please check the following:

- Make sure you have the latest version of conda installed.
- Verify that the requirements.yaml file is in the correct location.
- Check that the conda environment is activated correctly.
